Battle Ship

I will use deep learning to teach a computer to play battleship. The steps I plan to take/ goals are: 
1. Write battleship game in python
2. Gym emv is available, so I will need to get the gym environment working 
  launce fastai deep learning rainbow dqm, launches cartpool
  change this so the input to network is to battleship game and it will expect atari and I will need to change it to text based thing. So that connects action of network to the battleship environment and when says x, we do x)
  run and see if this works
3. Deep Q learning, look at board and estimate how good it is (In this board am I about to win? Great board) and make decisions to get closer to winning boards
4. Evaluate and keep repeating steps: How long are the games? When plays a random agent, how often does my machine win?
