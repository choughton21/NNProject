Software will be using: 
 - Python to write the battleship game
 - openai gym 
 I will be using stable baselines3 reinforcement learning library for the implementation of the learning algorithm and I will use pytorch to build my neural network

Data coming from: 
- will be using reinforcement learning


Input to network:
- the board game from the python battleship program I will write, and it will be a two-dimensional array

Expected output from network:
- the actions (moves) which I will represent as a one-dimensional array
