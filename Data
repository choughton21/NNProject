Software will be using: 
 - Python to write the battleship game
 - openai gym 
 I will be using stable baselines3 reinforcement learning library for the implementation of the learning algorithm and I will use pytorch to build my neural network

Data coming from: 
- will be using reinforcement learning


Input to network:
- the board game from the python battleship program I will write, and it will be a two-dimensional array

Expected output from network:
- the actions (moves) which I will represent as a one-dimensional array


Update 2:

I have begun the progress by downlowding visual studios and writing battlehsip in java and this is in the starting phases.
I have explored further how to use the openai gym and also what types of training might make the most sense based on some
readings of others' projects in the board-game AI research I was able to find on Google. I have encountered issues based
on this being new to me and sometimes the set-up actually takes a bit of time before I can actually get to the reinforcement
learning, meat, of the project. 

I am aiming for a grade of A in the class
