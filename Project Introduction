Battleship

I am going to teach a computer to play battleship, and this is interesting becasue battleship
is a technical game and the best way to play the game might change as the game progresses. The
main reason this is a challenging task is that we need advanced algorithms to learn how to play
the game, if we want our AI to play well. The learning technique needs to understand how to learn
well. If an adult plays battelship against a toddler who makes moves randomly, the adult will win
almost every time. Our goal is to train the computer to play less like a toddler making random 
moves and more like a skilled adult; this is a challenging task. The fact that deep learning is
a black box is a further difficulty since we cannot help the computer learn better since we do
not know how it is learning exactly, and we only see performance. We hope to find that after 
training, our AI is able to play battleship well beyond that of a random player.
