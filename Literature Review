1. Measuring AI advancement through games
This article talks about the progress of AI in terms of playing several different board games. Some of the games they look into are Chess, Pacman, Texas hold'em, 
Jeoparty, Atari, and Dota2. These games have all been conquered at some level, and most of them have an AI which can beat all human players. There is one game 
which is yet to be conquered and that game is Bridge. The article also talks to OpenAI and their platform, universe, to continue training AI for games and other

then in 2017 the AI beat GO grandmaster Ke Jie. In terms of AI and learning to play board games this was a huge accomplishment. The game was
livestreamed on Youtube. The number of possible boards for GO is larger than the number of atoms in the universe.

4.Youtube OpenAI plays hide and seek
This video talks us through a project OpenAI ran which was for two teams to compete and play hide and seek. It is interesting because the teams have to adapt to 
each other while they are playing. We see that the games start crazily and finally the hiders learn to lock out the seekers to win in general. The hider-teams
had to learn to work together. They found some errors with the way they coded the physics, and it created some fun-to-watch results that would not be possible
in a real game of hide and seek.
